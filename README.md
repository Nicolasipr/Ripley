Ripley's Trainee Admission Test

## Before Reading

This repository is meant for Ripley's Trainee Admission Test coordination and pacing.

I'll be using [C++11](https://isocpp.org/), so make sure that you have [g++](https://gcc.gnu.org/) Compatible version running
 under your machine if you're considering running into.
 
 In some cases you'll have to run the code with:
 ```
$ g++ main.cpp -o main -Wall -Wextra && ./main 
```
